See [VuePress Website](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) for documentation. This
project is a very basic VuePress boilerplate. Please note the the markdown
documents to be published are located in the `./docs` directory. 

All configuration ist to be found in `./docs/.vuepress` and this boilerplate is
configured in such a way that the build directory is `./dist` instead of the
default `./docs/.vuepress/dist`.

## Quickstart

```bash
yarn install
# for development run
yarn dev
# if you wan to build the static files for production run
yarn build
```
