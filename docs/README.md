# Documentation

This directory contains the documentation source for both, users and developers. 
We are using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to generate a nice
looking, static site from the files in this directory.

Please note that the API documentaiton is auto-generated from the source code
with swagger, hence it is part of the `./app/api` component. A link to the API
Documentation should be place in the header of the global docs anyway.
